# tia_doherty_code_sample
This repo is a modified version of a script I made as the first step in a data pipeline that I created in my role as Data Engineer at Comcast. The intention was to use a custom Python script to pull in data from an internally built API, and have dynamic job configuration variables so multiple tables can be loaded from the same script. For this exercise, I have two sample files that show the data necessary for the transformations in the script.
